Guacamole
---------

5 small avocados
Juice of 1 large lime (lemon-sized) or 2 small
1/2 tsp. salt
1 tsp. ground coriander
4-5 cloves, crushed to powder
2 Tbsp. chopped yellow onion

Combine all ingredients in a food processor and blend until smooth but chunky. Add salt to taste; add lime juice (sparingly!) to taste.
