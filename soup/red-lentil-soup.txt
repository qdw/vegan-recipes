Indian Red Lentil Soup
======================

Ingredients: Basics
-------------------
1 large yellow onion, chopped
1
L/2 lb. kale, chopped
2 to 3 large lemons, juiced
1/2 can whole plum tomatoes, chopped (without juice)
1 1/2 cups red lentils
6 cups vegetable stock
Olive oil
Fresh-ground black pepper
Salt

Ingredients: Spices
-------------------
2 tsp peeled and grated fresh ginger
2 Tbsp ground coriander
2 tsp ground cumin
1/2 tsp ground turmeric
pinch of cayenne pepper

1. Saute the onion in copious olive oil till translucent, about 8 minutes.

2. Meanwhile, measure all the spices. When the onion is ready, add the spices,
   turn the heat to low, and cook, stirring, about 3 minutes. Be careful not
   to let the spices stick to the bottom of the pot.

3. Add the lentils and stock. Bring to a boil, then simmer, stirring
   occasionally, for 30 minutes, till stew is thick (note to self:
   on my electric stove, simmer on the left front burner for 15 minutes
   on 2.5, then 15 minutes at 2.0).

4. Turn off the heat. Stir in the tomatoes and kale.

5. Add salt, pepper, and lemon juice to taste, being careful not to overdo
   the lemon juice!

    Pro Tips

Don't forget to stir, or the soup will burn on the bottom of your pot!

The longer you simmer, the better the soup tastes. If you simmer for a long
time, you might need to add water to compensate for the water lost as steam.
